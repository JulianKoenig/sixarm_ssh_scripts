##
# SSH script to generate our typical keys:
#
#   * Type: use the RSA algorithm because it's the widest used.
#   * Bits: use 4096 because it's stronger than default 2048.
#   * Comment: use the file name, which has the email, ZID, etc.
#   * Passphrase: yes
#
# File name convention:
#
#   * Use the email address, so a user's keys will sort together.
#   * Generate an ZID, akin to a UUID4 with only letters and numbers.
#   * Use the word "automation" or "passphrase".
#   * End with "id_rsa" which is SSH convention.
#   * Separate items by using an equal sign, because it's not in email adddresses.
#   * Thus the file name is "<email>=<zid>=passphrase=id_rsa".
#
# Example:
#
#     ssh-keygen-with-email-zid-passphrase alice@example.com
#
# Output files:
#
#     alice@example.com=34150d8e0d19ddbaec70d2e600166876=passphrase=id_rsa
#     alice@example.com=34150d8e0d19ddbaec70d2e600166876=passphrase=id_rsa.pub
